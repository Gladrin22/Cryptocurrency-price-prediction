# Cryptocurrency-price-prediction

The emergence of cryptocurrency is increasing rapidly in modern society. Meanwhile it has become common for anyone to create and launch their own cryptocurrencies as often as they want.   But anyways some investors are very keen about the famous crypto currencies such as bitcoins, ethereum etc.. They also care about the top performing coins and also the coinâ€™s validity and its integrity . So , it would be better if we had a software which can predict and forecast the cryptocurrency prices of some of the famous cryptocurrencies based upon the previous performances of the crypto data . This is what our project is all about . The cryptocurrency price prediction using machine learning t is one of many ways for us to get a guess of what the upcoming cryptocurrency market would look like . So , in this project by using the Facebook- Prophet library we are forecasting the cryptocurrency price conditions of some famous crypto coins  like (Bitcoin , Ethereum , Binance Coin, USD Coin , DogeCoin , Shiba Inu, Lite Coin)'). So that the investors can invest in their crypto portfolio with more clarity and with confidence . Our cryptocurrency price predictor uses yahoo finance to get the crypto data from previous years meaning from 2010 until our present day . Then the crypto predictor uses python as a de-facto language . It was built with the help of streamlit then hosted by using Heroku.
